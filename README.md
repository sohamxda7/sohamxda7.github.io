## About Me  
I started my career in analog layout and transitioned into scripting, focusing primarily on Cadence Skill, TCL, and Linux system administration. Currently, I work full-time as a Cadence Skill scripter, IT support specialist, system administrator, and teacher at my company. 

I help automate various processes for layout and schematic design using Cadence Skill scripting. My work improves the efficiency and output of layout designers by saving time through automation. With experience in both backend scripting and GUI development, I focus on creating tools that streamline workflows and enhance productivity.

I'm always exploring new technologies and love solving complex problems.
