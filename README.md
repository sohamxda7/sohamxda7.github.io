# Soham Sen  
**Full-Stack Scripting Specialist (VLSI Automation) | IT Support | Linux System Administrator | Server Management & Networking Professional**  

Welcome to my portfolio! Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast with professional expertise in full-stack scripting, focusing on Cadence Skill and TCL scripting for VLSI automation, server management, and secure networking solutions.

## About Me  
My career started in analog layout, working with tools like Cadence Virtuoso IC 6.1.7 and StabieSoft Slam. As I transitioned into scripting, I specialized in automating VLSI workflows using Cadence Skill and TCL, delivering efficiency in both backend automation and frontend GUI development.  

In addition to VLSI scripting, I have substantial experience in server management and networking. I've worked with cloud platforms like Amazon EC2, DigitalOcean, and Google GCP to deploy and manage servers securely. My expertise includes setting up SSH tunnels (both local and remote forwarding), port forwarding for network access, and implementing VPNs to ensure secure, remote access to critical infrastructure. These solutions help safeguard sensitive systems while providing seamless remote management.  

I'm passionate about exploring cutting-edge technologies and solving complex problems through automation and secure infrastructure deployment.
