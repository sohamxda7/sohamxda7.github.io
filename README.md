## About Me  
I began my career in analog layout, working with Cadence Virtuoso IC 6.1.7, 6.1.8, and StabieSoft Slam. After six months, I transitioned into VLSI scripting, focusing on Cadence Skill and TCL, while expanding my role in server management and Linux system administration. Currently, I work full-time as a Cadence Skill scripter, server manager, and Linux system administrator at my company.

I automate complex processes for layout and schematic design using Cadence Skill scripting, optimizing efficiency for layout designers. I’m also deeply involved in managing servers, securing infrastructures, and deploying solutions that ensure stability and performance across networks. My expertise in backend scripting, GUI development, and networking allows me to deliver high-impact tools and services that streamline workflows and enhance security.
